## Debuggable scheduler

The "debuggable scheduler" is the core component of the simulator,
which is responsible for scheduling Pods like the normal scheduler, but also recording all the scheduling details to the Pod annotations.

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hoge-pod
  annotations:
    scheduler-simulator/bind-result: '{"DefaultBinder":"success"}'
    scheduler-simulator/filter-result: >-
      {"node-282x7":{"AzureDiskLimits":"passed","EBSLimits":"passed","GCEPDLimits":"passed","InterPodAffinity":"passed","NodeAffinity":"passed","NodeName":"passed","NodePorts":"passed","NodeResourcesFit":"passed","NodeUnschedulable":"passed","NodeVolumeLimits":"passed","PodTopologySpread":"passed","TaintToleration":"passed","VolumeBinding":"passed","VolumeRestrictions":"passed","VolumeZone":"passed"},"node-gp9t4":{"AzureDiskLimits":"passed","EBSLimits":"passed","GCEPDLimits":"passed","InterPodAffinity":"passed","NodeAffinity":"passed","NodeName":"passed","NodePorts":"passed","NodeResourcesFit":"passed","NodeUnschedulable":"passed","NodeVolumeLimits":"passed","PodTopologySpread":"passed","TaintToleration":"passed","VolumeBinding":"passed","VolumeRestrictions":"passed","VolumeZone":"passed"}}

The simulator works with the debuggable scheduler built from the upstream scheduler by default,
and the web UI just visualizes those scheduling details on the annotations.

## Integrate your plugins to the simulator

You can integrate your plugins to the simulator, that is, to the debuggable scheduler working within the simulator, by following these steps:

1. Register your plugins [here](../cmd/scheduler/scheduler.go#L17) in a very similar way you do with the normal scheduler.

```go
    command, cancelFn, err := debuggablescheduler.NewSchedulerCommand(
        debuggablescheduler.WithPlugin(yourcustomplugin.Name, yourcustomplugin.New),
        debuggablescheduler.WithPluginExtenders(noderesources.Name, extender.New), // [optional] see plugin-extender.md about PluginExtender.
    )
```

2. Rebuild the scheduler and restart.

```sh
make docker_build docker_up_local
```

### The plugin extender

We have the plugin extender feature to provide more debuggability from the debuggable scheduler.
See [plugin-extender.md](./plugin-extender.md).

### Use the debuggable scheduler in your dev cluster

The debuggable scheduler can work outside the simulator, that is, in your clusters too.
which allows you to have the same debuggability with your custom scheduler in real clusters.

It's just a single binary that doesn't contain anything but the debuggability features that we described so far.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not recommend using it in the production cluster because the debuggable scheduler contains the overhead.
> Also, you may want to pay attention to the fact that the annotations would be visible to all cluster users,
> which could leak the hints of other tenants to cluster users.

### The example debuggable scheduler

We have the sample to show how to implement the debuggable scheduler in [./sample/debuggable-scheduler](./sample/debuggable-scheduler).
